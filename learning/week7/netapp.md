Our team determines the following questions are too complex for Tableau and
require custom scripts to be written.

* The development of [Time Maps](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/time-maps-visualizing-discrete-events-across-many-timescales) might be to complex for Tableau.  Time Maps could be used to graph observations based on their time difference from the previous observation (x-axis) and the next observation (y-axis).  We already have the x-axis values.  These are the Delta Times.  We would need to calculate the y-axis values which are the deltas between the current Observation Time and the next for a particular system.
